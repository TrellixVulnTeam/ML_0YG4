    "All forms of Gradient Descent might suffer from features with very different scales. This is because they will converge slower since the gradient descent will take a circuitous route to the minimum as 4-7 illustrates. I like to think about this as an ellipse and the gradient descent goes towards the semi major axis first, once it reaches there it heads along it towards the minimum. To fix this you can standard scale or min max scale the features."

Most of the time it's close enough, but Batch Gradient descent will converge smoothly to a specific minimum. However, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent may \"bounce\" around the global minimum. However, if you gradually lower the learning rate they will become closer and closer to BGD."

There are various methods to prevent overfitting including: Use a less complicated model, use Ridge, Lasso, or Elastic Net regularization, increase the size of your (training) dataset.

For example, the validation error could be consistently going down, increase for one epoch, and then go down for the next 10 epochs. The patience factor says something like \"if _ epochs go by without a decrease in the validation error, then stop (and revert to minimum validation error model)\"."
