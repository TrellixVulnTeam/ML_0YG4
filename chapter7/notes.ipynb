    "## Voting Classifiers\n",
    "* A voting classifier uses the predictions of multiple diverse predictors (models) and has each one vote and then picks the majority vote\n",
    "* This is called a hard voting classifier\n",
    "* You can achieve high accuracy from a bunch of weak learners\n",
    "* \"Suppose you build an ensemble containing 1,000 classifiers that are individually correct only 51% o the time (barely better than random guessing). If you predict the majority voted class, you can hope for up to 75% accuracy!\"\n",
    "* However in practice this is only true if the classifiers are all independent of one another, which isn't the case since they were all trained on the same data\n",
    "* Ensemble methods work best when the predictors are as independent from one another as possible (e.g. use different training algorithms). This will allow them to make different types of errors, increasing the models accuracy.\n",
    "* Soft voting is when you use predictors which have the `predict_proba` method (i.e. they predict probabilities). You pick the class with the highest class probability, averaged over all the individual classifiers. This is often more effective because it gives higher weight to higher confidence votes, whereas in hard voting they are all equally weighted (even though some individual models may be unconfident in the result).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bagging and Pasting\n",
    "* Instead of using completely different algorithms to produce an ensemble model, another way to do so is to train the same algorithm on different random subsets of the training set\n",
    "* This technique is known as bagging and pasting\n",
    "* Bagging (short for bootstrap aggregating) is when you sample randomly from the training set with replacement\n",
    "* Pasting is when you sample randomly from the training set without replacement\n",
